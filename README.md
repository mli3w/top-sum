## 🎮 What is Top Sum?

Top Sum is a fast-paced 3D math game where learning happens through:

- movement
- focus
- timing
- flow

Instead of worksheets or flashcards, players pilot a plane through Marina Bay and steer toward the correct answer gates.

Chain correct answers together to:
- build streaks
- increase speed
- unlock faster and more advanced planes
- charge a ZOOOM cinematic lap with F-16 escorts
- trigger cinematic slow-motion moments
- unlock new flight experiences

It's less:
> "solve this question"

and more:
> **stay focused, stay in flow, don't break the streak**

## 🚀 30-Second Start

1. Open the link above (or `index.html` locally)
2. Pick a difficulty — **Tiny** for first-time learners, **Hard** for everyone else
3. Steer toward the gate showing the correct answer
4. Don't break the streak

## 🧠 Why I Built This

This started as a small project for my sister-in-law's son over a long weekend.

At the same time, I was exploring how AI can help prototype interactive ideas faster — especially small interactive learning experiences for kids.

I also made a simplified Tiny Mode for my 4-year-old.

The result became:
> a free, open-source experiment in making maths feel more like play than repetition.

## ⚡ Features

### ✈️ Arcade Flight Gameplay
- Fly through the correct answer gates
- Wrong answers or collisions cost lives
- Fast restart loop designed for "one more run"

### 🔥 Flow System
- Consecutive correct answers increase your multiplier (×1 → ×2 → ×3 → ×4)
- Dynamic speed scaling
- "Flow State" visual effects and slow-motion moments

### 🛩 Plane Upgrades on Streaks
Five plane tiers swap in automatically as your streak builds:

| Streak | Plane Tier |
|-------:|:-----------|
| 0      | Tier 1 (starter) |
| 3      | Tier 2 |
| 5      | Tier 3 |
| 10     | Tier 4 |
| 20     | Tier 5 (top of the line) |

Lose your streak and you drop back. Stay in flow to keep flying the best plane.

### 🚀 ZOOOM Boost
Each correct answer fills a glowing **ZOOOM bar** at the top of the screen. When it's full, tap the bar (or press `Z`) to fire:

- A 3/4-circuit cinematic lap — no math questions, just sky
- Two F-16 escort jets fade in from behind, lock onto your wings, and peel off climbing into the distance
- Base speed bumped 2.2×, camera FOV widens, screen edges streak with warp-tunnel rays
- Fireworks blooming over the bay throughout the lap
- A triumphant 3-note rising sting at activation

Charge thresholds vary by difficulty — Tiny: 5, Easy: 7, Medium / Hard: 10. Tap the bar mid-question and it'll auto-fire after you answer — no rug-pull.

### ⚡ Speed Mode
For fast players who find the base pace too gentle. Toggle on the title screen, the in-game ⚡ icon, or press `S` for a **50% faster base speed** on every difficulty. Stacks with the Flow multiplier and ZOOOM.

### 🌆 Cinematic Marina Bay World
- Stylised Singapore skyline (Merlion, bay, boats, water)
- Day and Sunset modes
- Fireworks during sunset
- A Chinook with a Singapore flag orbits at altitude during the day
- Occasional NDP-style RSAF fighter formation flypast with contrails
- Dynamic lighting and atmosphere

### 🎮 Built for Desktop + Mobile
- Keyboard controls (arrows / WASD)
- Mobile joystick
- Mobile D-pad alternative
- First-time onboarding for younger kids
- Pause / resume from anywhere

### 🚀 Progression & Unlocks
- High-score persistence (localStorage, no signup)
- **Sunset Mode** unlocks at 1000 points with a cinematic celebration
- Streak milestones with visual rewards
- Score sharing (Web Share API, with clipboard fallback)
